get_next_line is a C function that reads a file or standard input line by line. It efficiently handles large files by reading chunks of data and dynamically managing memory to return complete lines. This function is often used in low-level file processing where standard I/O functions like fgets or getline are not allowed.
Features

    Line-by-Line Reading: Reads and returns one line at a time from a file descriptor.
    Dynamic Memory Allocation: Handles varying line lengths using malloc, ensuring efficient memory usage.
    Customizable Buffer Size: The BUFFER_SIZE macro allows users to adjust the reading chunk size for better performance.
    Supports Multiple File Descriptors: Keeps track of different file descriptors, allowing concurrent reading from multiple files.
    Handles Newline Characters: Correctly identifies and returns complete lines, including newline characters when applicable.
    Works with Standard Input (stdin): Can read input from the terminal, making it useful for interactive programs.

How It Works

    Reads a predefined number of bytes (BUFFER_SIZE) from the given file descriptor.
    Stores the read data in a static buffer to keep track of unprocessed content.
    Extracts the next available line from the buffer and returns it as a null-terminated string.
    If the buffer does not contain a complete line, it continues reading until a newline or EOF is encountered.
    Manages memory efficiently to prevent leaks and optimize performance.
    
Requirements & Constraints

    Must only use allowed system calls: read, malloc, and free.
    Static variables may be used to manage persistent buffer data between function calls.
    Must work efficiently with different BUFFER_SIZE values.

Potential Use Cases

    Processing large text files without loading everything into memory.
    Implementing text-based command-line tools.
    Reading logs or configuration files efficiently.
    Handling real-time input streams line by line.
